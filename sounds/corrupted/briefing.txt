Commander, scans indicate that there is a Corrupted presence in your sector.  When we landed on Aolea 4, a presence was felt. This presence managed to infiltrate our systems without our knowledge. By the time we detected an issue, it had commandeered our most advanced synthetic intelligence systems for it's own purposes. We have been getting reports from other Commanders of interactions with these Corruptors. So far, all interactions with the Corrupted have resulted in heavy losses. They are resiliant and reproduce quickly. You have precious little time to prepare before they attack. Good luck, Commander! Overseer Synthetic Intelligence Allison, out.
