					<h1 style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; margin: 0.67em 0;">
						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">SplinterFaction: Chronicle of Iammas</strong>
					</h1>

					<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1em 0;">
						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">Prologue: The Twin Eyes of War</strong>
					</h3>

					<p>
						High above the blue-green world of <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Iammas</strong>, two pale moons watched in silence.
						The Iammians called them <em style="font-style: italic;">The Twin Eyes of Loz</em>, named for the goddess of war.
						Their shifting pull reshaped oceans and continents, forcing tribes together in conflict.
						From these violent tides, a civilization was forged in blood and steel.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Iammians, cold-blooded, scaled, and cunning, mastered both sea and land.
						They fought for gods, for pride, for territory.
						Bronze gave way to gunpowder, empires rose and fell, and in time, two superpowers emerged:
						the <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Northern Coalition</strong> and the <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Southern World Order</strong>.
					</p>

					<p>
						For centuries, they balanced on the knife’s edge of annihilation.
						When the first Iammian stepped onto one of the Twin Eyes, peace collapsed.
						The Cold War became the <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Space War</strong>.
					</p>

					<p>
						In orbit, soldiers died among shattered hulls and frozen blood.
						And from that carnage came two inventions that reshaped history:
						the <strong style="font-weight: bold;">K.T. Shield</strong>, capable of bending light and energy itself,
						and the <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Mass Drive</strong>, opening the stars to Iammas in a single leap.
					</p>

					<p>
						With these, the Southern World Order triumphed, and for the first time in ten thousand years, silence fell over Iammas.
						But peace never lasts.
					</p>

					<hr>

					<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1em 0;">
						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">Act I: The Age of Expansion</strong>
					</h3>

					<p>
						The Order turned its gaze to the heavens.
						Six worlds were found, fertile, rich, and arrayed in a crescent constellation the Iammians named
						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">The Arm of Kala</strong>, after the goddess of peace.
						The Outer Colonies were born.
					</p>

					<p>
						But distance breeds defiance.
						The colonies, free of Iammas’ tides and tyranny, rebelled.
						The Order’s response was swift and brutal... orbital bombardments, martial law, executions.
						Just as calm returned, fate intervened.
					</p>

					<p>
						During a rare magnetic shift, Iammas’ defenses fell just as its sun unleashed the largest solar flare ever recorded.
						The planet was bathed in radiation.
						Systems failed, networks collapsed, and within hours civilization burned.
						Nuclear fire finished what the storm had begun.
					</p>

					<p>
						The homeworld descended into a new dark age.
						The colonies… simply watched.
					</p>

					<hr>

					<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1em 0;">
						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">Act II: The Rise of the Federation</strong>
					</h3>

					<p>
						For the first time in their history, the Outer Colonies stood alone... and prospered.
						Trade flourished, cities gleamed, and the Iammians of the Arm of Kala formed a new alliance:
						the <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Federation of Kala</strong>, dedicated to unity, progress, and expansion.
					</p>

					<p>Then came the discovery of <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Nu-Gua</strong>.</p>

					<p>
						It was a perfect world, oceans, breathable air, and cities glittering below the clouds.
						But when the Federation ship <em style="font-style: italic;">Celestial Maiden</em> reached orbit and sent its first signal,
						the inhabitants mistook it for an attack.
						A nuclear missile (primitive, but deadly) struck from the far side of the planet, vaporizing the vessel.
					</p>

					<p>The Federation declared war.</p>

					<p>
						What followed was swift and merciless.
						The <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Xenos</strong> of Nu-Gua (hairless, soft-skinned bipeds) fought bravely but were crushed under orbital bombardment.
						Occupation followed, and so did division among the Iammians themselves.
					</p>

					<hr>

					<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1em 0;">
						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">Act III: The Splintering</strong>
					</h3>

					<p>
						Half the colonies, led by <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Rohini</strong> and <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Mot</strong>, called for restraint.
						“Teach them,” they argued. “Guide them.”
						The others, <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Kali</strong>, <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Bi Xiu</strong>,
						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">Ashiesha</strong>, and <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Pascia</strong>, demanded vengeance and extermination.
						To them, the Xenos were beasts that had murdered Iammian lives.
					</p>

					<p>The debate shattered the Federation.</p>

					<p>
						When Rohini and Mot intervened to protect Nu-Gua’s survivors, the Federation branded them traitors.
						In orbit above the planet, Iammian warships turned their cannons upon their own kin.
						The <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Loz Alliance</strong> was born in that moment,
						a coalition of defenders who swore to shield the innocent, even from their own species.
					</p>

					<p>And for the first time, the Xenos fought beside their former conquerors.</p>

					<hr>

					<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1em 0;">
						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">Intermission: The Fire of Nu-Gua</strong>
					</h3>

					<p>
						The war for Nu-Gua became legend.
						Xeno commandos, armed with Iammian technology, sacrificed themselves to cripple the Federation’s power grids.
						The Loz Alliance pushed forward, driving the Federation fleet back.
						The Xenos (once seen as vermin) became brothers-in-arms.
					</p>

					<p>
						Back in the core worlds, the Federation was fracturing.
						Some sought peace; others demanded the total annihilation of the Loz Alliance.
						As fleets massed around <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Mot</strong>, war spread across the stars once more.
					</p>

					<p>
						While the Federation built weapons of mass devastation, the Loz Alliance built something greater...
						<em style="font-style: italic;">hope</em>.
						On Nu-Gua, Iammians and Xenos shared their science, art, and culture.
						The Alliance forged energy shields that could regenerate faster than flesh,
						a living defense born from the fusion of two species’ ingenuity.
						The Federation, obsessed with offense and speed, perfected regenerative hulls and devastating plasma arrays.
					</p>

					<p>And so the galaxy became divided. Two philosophies, two civilizations, forever at odds.</p>

					<hr>

					<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1em 0;">
						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">Epilogue: The Splinter War</strong>
					</h3>

					<p>
						The Federation of Kala and the Loz Alliance stand as reflections of each other.
						One ruled by vengeance, the other by conviction.
						Both born from the ashes of the same world.
						Both believing their path is salvation.
					</p>

					<p>
						Now, the long shadow of war falls once again.
						The Twin Eyes of Loz gleam coldly over a divided sky.
						And in their light, the Iammians march,
						not for peace,
						not for gods,
						but for the future of every world they’ve ever touched.
