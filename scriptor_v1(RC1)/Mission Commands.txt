Everything Listed here is pure speculation, the only way to be sure
would be to see an original Cavedog bos with such a command.

The mission command so far as I,ve seen has at least three parts:
  1. The first param is always a string. This string contains the
     the actual command to be performed and some additional parameters.
  2. After the string there is sometimes a few params, depending on
     what the string was.
  3. The mission command seems to return a value. When it doesn't there
     is a post command value of 0x10024000.

Mission Command stuff I've seen so far:

-Possible Values in the String:
