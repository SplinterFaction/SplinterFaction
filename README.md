# What is SplinterFaction?

SplinterFaction is a real-time strategy (RTS) game set in a science fiction universe. Players are immersed in a rich lore that unfolds across multiple factions, with the main focus being on the conflict between the Loz Alliance and the Federation of Kala.

The game takes place after the collapse of the Iamman homeworld, Iammas, due to catastrophic events. The Outer Colonies, freed from Iammas' rule, form the Loz Alliance, while the Federation of Kala seeks to assert its dominance and control over the galaxy. The discovery of the Xenos, a technologically inferior yet warlike species, adds a new political dynamic to the conflict.

Players can choose to align themselves with either the Loz Alliance or the Federation of Kala. Each faction offers unique units, technologies, and strategies. The Loz Alliance excels in deploying long-range, heavily armored units, relying on advanced shielding technology and overwhelming brute force, while the Federation of Kala specializes in employing cloaking capabilities, swift mobility, and devastating firepower.

As players progress through the game, they engage in intense battles across various planets, strategically managing resources, researching new technologies, and commanding armies in both ground and space warfare. The game also delves into the political and cultural complexities of the factions, exploring themes of alliances, betrayals, and the struggles for power and survival.

Ultimately, the fate of the galaxy rests in the players' hands as they shape the outcome of the conflict between the Loz Alliance and the Federation of Kala. The choices they make and the strategies they employ will determine the course of the war and the future of the Iamman people and the Xenos.

Yes you can! Download keys are limited, however. The game is not ready for a prime release, so understand that what you are seeing is (a lot of the time) *very* WIP and not representative of the final game.
